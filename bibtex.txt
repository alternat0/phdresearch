  abstract = {In the last ten years, electronic voting has been used in an ever growing number of elections. There are many reasons for this development. First, some election modes require a mechanized way for counting since the number of questions or the number of choices is too large for a manual counting. Electronic voting also allows one to vote from home, possibly avoiding long travels. Sometimes, it simply follows the trend of using Internet in our daily life.},
